## Folder structure for PR 
We are expecting multiple different approaches to this solution. Each proposed solution will be in its own folder within the problem folder. To submit a new solution create a new folder under solutions and add your script, results and description. You can also improve an existing solution by contributing to it.   

    incubator
    |- 2024-06_rastrapati_sikshya_karyakram_viz
       |- solutions
          |- solution1
          |  |- README.md = URL to demo dahsboard, implementation description, methodology and contributor names 
          |  |- impl      = pre-processing and implementation scripts
          |  |- work      = intermediate files 
          |   
          |- solution2
             |- ...

The folder structure within solution is indicative only, feel free to use a different structure as applicable.

### Technology stack
We expect contributors to use existing BI tools that allow us to publicly host datasets and dashboards, preferably with no financial burden to the government. We have used Flourish, Tableau Public, and Google Data Studio in the past, but we are open to any new stack which has similar or better feature sets.
